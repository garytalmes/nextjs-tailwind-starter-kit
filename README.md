# NextJS + Tailwind Starter Kit

This is a small, modestly-opiniated starter-kit for combining NextJS with Tailwind (with Typescript support included).

## Versions

This kit supports:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.com) v13.1 (not using the new routing system)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) v4.9.4 
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) v3.2.4

## Other Features 

- A `.vscode` folder is included, as it has some useful utilities for dealing with VSCode's dislike of the various directives on Tailwind's *global.css* file.
- All key files are located inside a root `src` folder, and tsconfig is mapped appropriately to that folder.
- I included [lodash](https://lodash.com) as well, as I find it indispensable.
- [TailwindForms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) is also included, as I make use of it all the time. I didn't include any other Tailwind packages, at least not for now.
- Anytime I use Tailwind I also use the excellent [clsx utility](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx), so that's included in the `package.json` also.

## Instructions

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Enjoy!
